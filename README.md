  - the changes in profit?losses and the average of those changes
  - the greatest increase in profits(date and amount) over the entire period
  - the greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The analysis should then be displayed in the terminal in the same format provided.

The Python code for PyPoll is slightly different. This is election data of a small, rural town.The Voter ID, County, and the Candidate voted for is all provided in the Data Set.

  - the total number of votes cast
  - a complete list of candidates who recieved votes
